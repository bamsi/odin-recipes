    <h1>Pizza Cupcakes</h1>
    <p>
      They're portable, sort of like a mini pizza, except shaped like a cupcake.
      They're a great savory snack and a great addition to a game day buffet.
      Feel free to customize to your family's tastes with additions like ham,
      sausage, bell peppers, salami, mushrooms, olives, jalapenos, etc. I
      recommend not omitting the tomato, that really adds something special.
